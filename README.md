### Build Your Own
This AngularJS project is wrapped in commonly used front end development tools to save you time. Development and production environments are configured to inject static assets managed by bower. Production build concats and compresses.
#### Install the dependencies  
`cd tv-maze`  
`npm install`  
`bower install`  
`npm install karma karma-chrome-launcher karma-jasmine`
`npm install -g karma-cli`
`karma start`

### Node Server

Build your package and point the node server to `/build/<environment>`    

`node web-server.js`  
[http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html)


### Node.JS Version 13.9.0
### I have used simple AngularJS based MVC architecture to build this app. I have chosen AngularJS to demonstrate my AngularJS skill since the job requirement is for AngularJS.
